Quaint is an abstraction over certain SQL databases. It provides:

- An AST for building dynamic SQL queries.
- Visitors for different databases to generate SQL strings.
- Connectors to abstract over results and querying.
- Pooling with [mobc](https://crates.io/crates/mobc)
- Async/await and Futures 0.3

### Documentation

- [Released](https://docs.rs/quaint)
- [Master](https://prisma.github.io/quaint/quaint/index.html)

### Feature flags

- `mysql`: Support for MySQL databases.
- `postgresql`: Support for PostgreSQL databases.
- `sqlite`: Support for SQLite databases.
- `mssql`: Support for Microsoft SQL Server databases.
- `pooled`: A connection pool in `pooled::Quaint`.
- `json`: JSON type support with `serde_json` crate.
- `uuid`: UUID type support with `uuid` crate.
- `chrono`: DateTime type support with `chrono` crate.
- `serde-support`: Deserialize support from result set with `serde` crate.
- `bigdecimal`: Numeric values can be read as `BigDecimal`.
- `vendored-openssl`: Statically links against a vendored OpenSSL library on
  non-Windows or non-Apple platforms.

### Goals:

- Query generation when the database and conditions are not known beforehand.
- Parameterized queries and SQL injection protection.
- A modular design, a separate AST and separate visitors and connectors.

### Non-goals:

- Database-level type-safety in query building or being an ORM.

For type-safe database abstraction, [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) is an excellent
choice.

### Testing:

- See `.envrc` for connection params. Override variables if different. MySQL,
  PostgreSQL and SQL Server needs to be running for tests to succeed.

Then:
  
``` sh
> cargo test
```

### Query debug

The queries can be logged by setting the `LOG_QUERIES` environment variable to any
value. They'll be logged at the `INFO` level and are visible when having a
logger in scope.
